1- the best method is the count inversion for the finding all the pairs that are greater than in the right.
2- given  a set of diffrent numbers,  find the largest subset of the number have same numbers,
like set can be possible -> {{1}, {1,2},  {1,2,6},  {1,2,6,7,8}}, 
not possible {{1,2} , {1,3} ,   {1,2,3}}
