base condition
recursion tree
stack - stores the function that are not completed
and when the fun calls it many times , or say no base condition then this stack overflows
and then the segmentation fault come in.

in recursion, you can - call call call , and when the base condition reached, then backtrack backtrack,.......
void printN(int n){
    if(n<=0) return;
    printN(n-1);
    cout<<n<<" ";
}
