Quick Sort

the intuition is make a pivot any element , lets make the first element of the array
pivot  = arr[low]
and then put it on its correct place then
consider 2 array , from low to pivotIndex and pivotIndex +1 to high, and apply same quick sort

 places all smaller elements to left of pivot and all greater elements to right of pivot.

how to find the correct place?
make two pointers i= low, and j= high, 
and then while loop if i found the high element and while loop -> j found the low element then the pivot , then swap arr[i] and arr[j]

swapping until the i>j , i crosses the j indexes

and then swap the pivot  to the arr[j], hence the j goes to the left of partition index  , and i goes to the right of it , (that's how the loop was breaked earlier) so that's why we swapped with  arr[j].
