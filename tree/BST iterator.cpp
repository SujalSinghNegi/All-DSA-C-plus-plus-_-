// here implementing the how to put a iterator in a BST
// like in the array we put pointer in the first index or at the last index
// similarly on the Inorder traversal of BST , if I put a iterator on the leftest index and then move the inorder then it will give the 
// elements in the ascending order , as i requested, not all elements in one time, 
// and if i put the iterator on the rightest, or say i reverse the procedure, i get the descending elements , in the reverse inorder
