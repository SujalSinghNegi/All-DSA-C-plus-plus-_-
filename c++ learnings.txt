you can resize the vector array after defining
vector<int>rank;
rank.resize(n+1,0);
whenever you have see in question that you have given 'n' elements or 
whenever you see the relationship of the elements then think of a Graph
whenever you see the the relationship matters and the elements are dependent to execute another element first then think of the topological sort.
