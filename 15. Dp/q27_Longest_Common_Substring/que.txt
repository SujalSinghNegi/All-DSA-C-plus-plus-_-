Problem statement

You have been given two strings “str1” and “str2”. You have to find the length of the longest common substring.

A string “s1” is a substring of another string “s2” if “s2” contains the same characters as in “s1”, in the same order and in continuous fashion also.
For example :

If “str1” = “abcjklp” and “str2” = “acjkp”  then the output will be 3.

Explanation : The longest common substring is “cjk” which is of length 3.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= |str1|, |str2| <= 100

where ‘T’ is the number of test cases and |str| is the length of the string str.

Sample Input 1:

2
abcjklp acjkp
wasdijkl wsdjkl

Sample Output 1:

3
3

Sample Input 2:

2
abcy acby
tyfg cvbnuty

Sample Output 2:

1
2

Explanation: The longest common substrings in first test case are “a”, "b", "c", “y” all having length 1.
