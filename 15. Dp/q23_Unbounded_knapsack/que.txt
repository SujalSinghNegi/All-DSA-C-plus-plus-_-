Knapsack with Duplicate Items
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 52.13%Submissions: 214K+Points: 4

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, represented by the array wt[] and val[] respectively. Also, a knapsack with a weight limit capacity.
Your task is to fill the knapsack in such a way that we can get the maximum profit. Return the maximum profit.

Note: Each item can be taken any number of times.

Examples:

Input: val[] = [1, 1], wt[] = [2, 1], capacity = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The optimal choice is to pick the 2nd element 3 times.

Input: val[] = [10, 40, 50, 70], wt[] = [1, 3, 4, 5], capacity = 8
Output: 110
Explanation: The optimal choice is to pick the 2nd element and the 4th element.

Input: val[] = [6, 8, 7, 100], wt[] = [2, 3, 4, 5], capacity = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't pick any element. Hence, total profit is 0.

Constraints:
1 ≤ val.size() = wt.size() ≤ 1000
1 ≤ capacity ≤ 1000
1 ≤ val[i], wt[i] ≤ 100
